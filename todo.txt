Misc:
  - The coins and the feather pictures that are just placed in the background for pretty much all pages
    doesn't position properly. It should just stay in place, no letting the screen on resize push it, just
    fixed in place (in Layout component).
  - Doc title fix for verify email pages, etc. 

  - "I see, so when they login, I will be listening to a event (probably a better name would be referralCoins) 
    if the user with the referral uses the referral it would be added to the referrer. And you know if the person 
    with the referral used it would be /register?referrel=<whatever> and that would trigger the event the referrer 
    is listening to, referralCoins to add the coins. I think I got it, but it will become more clearer when we start to use pusher"
