Misc:
  - The coins and the feather pictures that are just placed in the background for pretty much all pages
    doesn't position properly. It should just stay in place, no letting the screen on resize push it, just
    fixed in place (in Layout component).

Header:
  - Log out button will just clear the token?

Footer (Status):
  - How are we going to get the clock to count down in real time.
  - The current dublons, how are we going to get that? It might be in the configuration action, but I don't know
    because Jose did that (We show the dublons on the header for small screens).
  - Chat and help buttons haven't been discussed, so we need to see whats going on there.

Login:
  - Fix types.

Register:
  - Fix types.

Password Reset:
  - Fix types.
  - There is two Password reset form components, one for the regular password reset page and one for
    the profile. We can keep it like this or we can just have one component for both.

Sponsors:
  - Waiting on the endpoints for getting the sponsors (I think they're just static now) and the POST for the winnings of
    the quiz.

Raffle:
  - Need to figure out if the current coins the user has is in the configuration action. So, we can store the coins in redux.

Deployment:
  - Need to figure out what the exact domain is, I think it's building-u.com.
