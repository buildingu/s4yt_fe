      content: `BACKGROUND:
      Max Schulte is a studio art assistant professor at Duke University. He sees his artistic practice and his role as an educator as extensions of one another. Both involve a balance between careful planning and improvisational strategies to shape an experience of curiosity, imagination, and discovery. His teaching philosophy revolves around helping others expand their ability to communicate a personal relationship with the world through storytelling.

      CHALLENGE:
      This challenge is about geography, place, and infrastructure and how it affects our lives. Choose a place/space you know well. Analyze how it has been designed; where it's located, for whom it's designed, and for what purpose. Identify the ways that the design enhances or interferes with our interaction with the space or with our connection with each other in it. Propose an artistic intervention that can provide relief from some of the negative things you've identified that interfere with a meaningful connection to the space and to the people in it.

      RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
      Start with a more global view of your selected space…with special attention to where it sits within your community. Is there a socioeconomic context that will impact who visits? 
      How can it be accessed? (Car, public transportation, foot,...) 
      Who can visit? Who cannot? Consider things like families, pets/wild animals, seniors and mobility-restricted people, visitors from other places,...Then move inside. Think about the shape of the space. 
      Is there indoor space? Is there outdoor space? What kind of amenities/services? Free? Paid? What kinds of restrictions are there if any? 
      Identify a specific problem or a problem area. Consider its impact on individuals and the community that the space can potentially serve. Develop a creative solution in the form of an “artistic intervention” that you can present through rough sketches or labeled plans. Use critical thinking to justify your choices and showcase how your solution addresses the core issues.

      EVALUATION CRITERIA:
      - Clarity of the description of the space
      - Consideration of public accessibility to and use of the space
      - Importance of identified problem/ problem area
      - Creative and innovative solution
      - Positive impact of the “artistic intervention” on the individual and/or on the community`, // actual challenge description + instructions

      title: "The Passion Pitch", // challenge title
      content: `BACKGROUND : 
        What do you want to be when you grow up? That's a loaded question these days! We used to know the options, the choices, the opportunities. But now, the nature of the post-secondary professional world is changing rapidly. Education is fundamentally based on preparing students for a somewhat predictable working environment. That predictability is evaporating. So, given the dramatic changes society is undergoing, for what are we, the teachers, preparing, you, our students? The answer: a culture of omnipresent change.

        Ok, cool. But what does this even mean? How do you prepare for a world that you can't quite envision because it's constantly shifting? Peering out into your future, what do they see? 
        Among other things, we suspect a complexly vast world peering over several enticing but unknown precipices, as parallel to your smaller, personal world characterized by a foggy vision of …uncertainty. That uncertainty about your future -  that unpredictability about your personal professional trajectories - has ramifications. Regarding adolescent identity, the American Psychological Association (APA) notes the following: “Identity refers to more than just how adolescents see themselves right now; it also includes what has been termed the “possible self”—what individuals might become and who they would like to become” (American Psychological Association 2002) .

        CHALLENGE : 
        The Passion Pitch challenges you to concretely imagine who and what you want to be in the very near future identifying the variety of your current skills, interests, personality traits, priorities and values that could shape different versions of your future selves.
        The Passion Pitch digital stories - between 60 and 90 seconds - will be about starting a new company post-secondary education, or launching an initiative - an action, a movement - right now to catalyze change and thought.

        RECOMMENDED APPROACH: 
        The Passion Pitch is not your everyday straight-up digital storytelling Challenge. The Passion Pitch asks you to explore the tenuous bridge between that which is within you and the ever changing world outside of you. How do you articulate that bridge and then create it? That requires both discipline and flexibility in the storytelling structures and The Passion Pitch provides three narrative frameworks to help guide you to your destinations : 

        1. The vlog : A good vlog has a theme. That theme can certainly be about talking to farmer's market retailers or working through a favorite video game, but the story being told needs to take the viewer on a journey with the vlogger in that activity. The goal is to get your viewers to go on a journey with you; not watch you during your daily activities. The driving force behind successful vlogging is character. This format leads with personality. The story that is being told begins and ends with the vlogger(s) - you. The vlogger(s) needs to matter; needs to give the audience a reason to care about them. And finally, as with most storytelling formats, the next level beyond theme and journey are the details of the story itself. The beginning, middle, and end; the obstacles and the climaxes. Vlogging is no different but can be harder: finding the drama in the details …of an idea and the deeply familiar.

        2. PSAs - PSAs are a particular breed of commercial that are not designed to sell a product, like commercials, but, … an attitude: they are a format designed to change people's attitudes about an issue, like eating healthily or appreciating and respecting diversity. That is what you are attempting to do as well: not change so much as shape an attitude about your idea. You are selling an idea and you want your PSA to open up your audience's mind to that idea. Not buy the idea - that will take several steps - just consider it, seriously. The Ad Council is a fantastic website that features many PSAs. To find a PSA-driven narrative strategy that works for you, we recommend screening several campaigns, take notes and decide: what is working and what isn't? Then adapt those strategies for your PSA.

        3. Movie Trailer / Show Open - This is a really fun format. It's both linear and non-linear simultaneously. It is designed to both tell a story, while teasing you want to know more. It's often fast-paced with many cuts. The Movie Trailer is specifically about providing you with enough information about plot, idea, and character, to entice you to desperately want to know how the story ends. The Show Open can be more of a mood piece that is designed to give you the flavor of a show, as well as point to a few key components, such a setting, character, or the central conceit. Either can play it literally or abstractly. In both cases, you will most likely want to use music/percussion to drive this from start to finish. Music and sound are especially important in this narrative format.

        Please choose one of these three basic narrative formats - all of which will be fully defined and detailed in the Process to follow - for your Passion Pitch. But hold on, hold on. These stories are designed to be thought-provoking, engaging and shared widely. Therefore, they must be …fun. Funny, perhaps. They must embody some of the qualities of unpredictability itself. So, there is a surprise twist to each of these stories. In each digital story, you must find a way to integrate one surprise twist, from the list below, into their Passion Pitch. Below, to get you started, there are some subject choices to get you going, although you can select/create your own area. However, you have to choose from one of the twists listed below and work inside one of the three narrative formats. Take a look and start brainstorming. 

        Suggested Subjects (OR choose your own!) :
        Food / Agriculture / Social Media / Gaming / Energy / Transportation / Education / Sports and Recreation / Animals / Urban Planning / Construction / Water / Media / The Arts /  Medicine / Engineering…

        Formats/Genres (choose one) : 
        - Pitch / Commercial / PSA 
        - Movie Trailer / Show Open
        - Vlog / Day in the Life

        Twists (15 seconds) (choose one) :
        Dancing / Singing / Mysterious, wrapped box…to be opened / Animation / A Parade / Outlandish
        Costume / Three Original Flags / Silence / Gymnastics/acrobatics / Rapping / The making of original art / Puppetry / Glorious Nature / A surmountable wall.

        EVALUATION CRITERIA : 
        Content command
        - The idea that drives the Passion Pitch is well thought out, practical and aspirational.
        - The shape of the idea - how it starts and evolves, and your role inside of it - is multi-dimensional and clear.

        Storytelling command 
        - Your command of the genre of storytelling  (Vlog, PSA or Movie Trailer) is both comprehensive and creatively applied.
        - The integration of the twist into your story is poignant, seamless and entertaining.

        Media command
        - Your mix of shots and imagery to both convey the idea and persuade us of its worth is exemplary.
        - The digital story is edited with just the right pacing to result in an engaging viewing experience.`, // actual challenge description + instructions

      title: "Porter Airlines Challenge", // challenge title
      content: `BACKGROUND :
        Working in an airline operations centre is a dynamic and challenging experience. Every day, there are both internal and external factors affecting the operation and the goal of those working in operations is to look ahead and resolve these problems before they impact the passengers. Luckily, there are a number of different roles working together because each decision that is made must take many different factors into consideration. But making decisions on uncertain and ever-changing elements can make things complicated especially when there are real people with real lives affected. So it's important to take all options into consideration. Remember, each passenger is traveling for a reason and the reputation of the company will be directly impacted. 

        
        Some roles in the System Operations Control Centre that can help you with this challenge:
        -The Duty Officer is accountable for the decision making to manage the operation through maintaining the flight schedule including canceling or delaying flights
        -The Flight Dispatchers are responsible for developing the flight plan to be provided to the Captain. They look at weather, fuel, aircraft limitations and characteristics, and different altitudes to fly at to avoid turbulence or weather.
        -The Operations Communication Specialists are responsible to disseminate operational information across the network and work with the Duty Officer to help provide information.
        -The Network Operation Coordinators are responsible for station level requests as well as assisting in weight and balance in coordination with the Dispatchers.
        -The Maintenance Operations Coordinators work with any crew who are experiencing maintenance issues on their aircraft as well as organizing maintenance work when there is an aircraft that needs to be taken out of service. 
        -Crew Schedulers are responsible for staffing of the flights as well as working through bookoffs and any unforeseen operational challenges.
        (Surprised at how many people work together to get flights to where they need to go?!!!)


        CHALLENGE :
        You're sitting at your desk and a flight dispatcher comes to you with concerns about the weather in Windsor; it's forecasted to be below minimum landing conditions (due to fog) for the arrival of the flight from Toronto you  are overseeing. You also can see that the weather conditions will be hovering at minimum for the remainder of the day.. Currently, it's an hour to departure so the flight hasn't boarded yet. The flight is sold out and all later flights are also sold out for the day.
        Please note that no flight can depart without having a secondary landing airport option and sufficient fuel to get to that airport…choosing to hover at your destination can impact that.
        Also, additional fuel than what was planned can be added but extra weight means removing passengers without space today - Is it worth it?


        As the duty officer it is your call to make decisions about whether the flight leaves and handle all of the implications of that decision.. Your decisions are strictly around passenger experience and the image of the airline. Do you take off? Do you wait ?Do you cancel? Do you have another plan? Detail your plan. Discuss what information you would get from your team to base your decision. If you choose to take off, please consider the scenario you expect/ hope for and the scenario you do not expect and any new decisions and their implications.


        RECOMMENDED APPROACH :
        -Before boarding - can delay or cancel the flight but what is the advantage of these options?
        -During flight - can turn the aircraft around and land back at Toronto or continue to Windsor where they will likely be put into a hold since the weather is forecasted for minimums
        -If choosing to continue the flight and the aircraft diverts to their alternate after holding, do you refuel and reattempt for Windsor or fly the passengers back to Toronto? Remember these passengers have already been put in a hold and diverted so they are getting increasingly frustrated.
        -  Be aware of “downline consequences” i.e. -What is the crew supposed to do after? What other flights is that aircraft supposed to do?


        EVALUATION CRITERIA :
        -Passenger experience and the passenger's perception of the company
        -Factors and options considered and thought process for each.
        -Consideration of “downline consequences” 
        -Balance between proactive and reactive decisions 
        -Financial considerations

      content: `BACKGROUND :
        Owning a Small Business is incredibly rewarding, but also very challenging. The smaller your business is, the more resource constraints you encounter. When trying to grow, one of the biggest tradeoffs is between time and money. This is especially true with marketing.

        There are many marketing channels. You can market directly to customers (B2C) with referral programs (word of mouth), social media and email funnels, and paid advertising (print or virtual). You can also market to other businesses to build through their customer base (B2B). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses with reach, time commitment, and cost.

        CHALLENGE : 
        You are a small business owner offering personal services (choose one that interests you or default to personal training to help MATRIX) and you need to increase your clientele. You have limited resources (time and money). If you do things yourself, the advertising budget is bigger but the time constraint is greater and each new client requires more time. If you pay someone to help, the advertising budget is lower but there is more time to handle the new clients. What would be your marketing strategy?

        RECOMMENDED APPROACH : 
        In order to help you to figure your marketing plan, answer the following  questions : 
        What audience would you target for growth? What marketing strategy or mix of strategies would you choose to grow your business? Explain why you think this would work best. 
        Adjusting your strategy is common in a small business. What criteria would you use to know if and when adjustments are needed? How would the criteria inform you about ways to change your strategy?
