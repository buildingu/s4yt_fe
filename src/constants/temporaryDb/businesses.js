        "BACKGROUND: \n\n Max Schulte is a studio art assistant professor at Duke Univsersity. He sees his artistic practice and  his role as an educator as extensions of one another. Both involve a balance between careful planning and improvisational strategies to shape an experience of curiosity, imagination, and discovery. His teaching philosophy revolves around helping others expand their ability to communicate a personal relationship with the world through storytelling. CHALLENGE :  This challenge is about geography, place, and infrastructure and how it affects our lives. Choose a place/space you know well. Analyze how it has been designed; where it's located, for whom it's designed, and for what purpose. Identify the ways that the design enhances or interferes with our interaction with the space or with our connection with each other in it. Propose an artistic intervention that can provide relief from some of the negative things you've identified that interfere with a meaningful connection to the space and to the people in it. RECOMMENDED APPROACH : Start with a more global view of your selected space…with special attention to where it sits within your community. Is there a socioeconomic context that will impact who visits? How can it be accessed.? (Car, public transportation, foot,..) Who can visit? Who cannot? (consider things like families, pets /wild animals, seniors and mobility-restricted people, visitors from other places,... Then move inside. Think about the shape of the space. Is there indoor space ? Is there outdoor space? What kind of amenities services? Free? Paid? What kinds of restrictions are there if any? Identify a specific problem or a problem area.  Consider its impact on individuals and the community that the space can potentially serve.  Develop a creative solution in the form of an “artistic intervention” that you can present through rough sketches or labeled plans. Use critical thinking to justify your choices and showcase how your solution addresses the core issues. EVALUATION CRITERIA : Clarity of the description of the space Consideration of public accessibility to and use of the space Importance of identified problem/ problem area Creative and innovative solution Positive impact of the “artistic intervention” on the individual and/or on the community", // actual challenge description + instructions

        "OVERVIEW: Owning a Small Business is incredibly rewarding, but also very challenging. The smaller your business is, the more resource constraints you encounter. When trying to grow, one of the biggest tradeoffs is between time and money. This is especially true with marketing. There are many marketing channels. You can market directly to customers (B2C) with referral programs (word of mouth), social media and email funnels, and paid advertising (print or virtual). You can also market to other businesses to build through their customer base (B2B). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses with reach, time commitment, and cost. CHALLENGE:  You are a small business owner offering personal services (choose one that interest you or default to personal training to help MATRIX) and you need to increase your clientele. You have limited resources (time and money). If you do things yourself, the advertising budget is bigger but the time constraint is greater and each new client requires more time. If you pay someone to help, the advertising budget is lower but there is more time to handle the new clients. What audience would you target for growth? What marketing strategy or mix of strategies would you choose to grow your business? Explain why you think this would work best.  Adjusting your strategy is common in a small business. What criteria would you use to know if and when adjustments are needed? How would the criteria inform you about ways to change your strategy? ", // actual challenge description + instructions
